This guide will walk you through installing Agent Router and its required components.

## Installing Agent Router

The easiest way to install Agent Router on Kubernetes is using the Helm charts. You need to install the CRDs first, followed by the AI Gateway controller.

If you want to run Agent Router as a standalone proxy outside Kubernetes, use [`aigw run`](../cli/run.md). The CLI can run directly on Linux and macOS, or from the Docker Compose examples in [`cmd/aigw`](https://github.com/theagentrouter/agent-router/tree/main/cmd/aigw). Those examples include an Ollama-backed stack and an OpenTelemetry stack for local traces and metrics.

### Step 1: Install AI Gateway CRDs

First, install the CRD Helm chart (`ai-gateway-crds-helm`) which manages all Custom Resource Definitions:

<CodeBlock language="shell">
{`helm upgrade -i aieg-crd oci://docker.io/envoyproxy/ai-gateway-crds-helm \\
    --version v${vars.aigwVersion} \\
    --namespace envoy-ai-gateway-system \\
    --create-namespace`}
</CodeBlock>

### Step 2: Install AI Gateway Resources

After the CRDs are installed, install the AI Gateway Helm chart:

<CodeBlock language="shell">
{`helm upgrade -i aieg oci://docker.io/envoyproxy/ai-gateway-helm \\
    --version v${vars.aigwVersion} \\
    --namespace envoy-ai-gateway-system \\
    --create-namespace

kubectl wait --timeout=2m -n envoy-ai-gateway-system deployment/ai-gateway-controller --for=condition=Available`}
</CodeBlock>

:::tip
Note that you are browsing the documentation for the main branch version of Agent Router, which is not a stable release.
We highly recommend you replace `v0.0.0-latest` with `v0.0.0-${commit hash of https://github.com/theagentrouter/agent-router}` to pin to a specific version.
Otherwise, the controller will be installed with the latest version at the time of installation, which can be unstable over time due to ongoing development (the latest container tags are overwritten).
:::

> If you are experiencing network issues with `docker.io`, you can install the helm charts from the code repo [ai-gateway-crds-helm](https://github.com/theagentrouter/agent-router/tree/{vars.aigwGitRef}/manifests/charts/ai-gateway-crds-helm) and [ai-gateway-helm](https://github.com/theagentrouter/agent-router/tree/{vars.aigwGitRef}/manifests/charts/ai-gateway-helm) instead.

:::tip Verify Installation

Check the status of the pods. All pods should be in the `Running` state with `Ready` status.

Check AI Gateway pods:

```shell
kubectl get pods -n envoy-ai-gateway-system
```

:::

:::note Upgrading from Previous Versions

If you installed AI Gateway with only `ai-gateway-helm` previously, first install the CRD chart with `--take-ownership` to transfer CRD ownership, then upgrade the main chart:

<CodeBlock language="shell">
{`helm upgrade -i aieg-crd oci://docker.io/envoyproxy/ai-gateway-crds-helm --version v${vars.aigwVersion} --namespace envoy-ai-gateway-system --take-ownership
helm upgrade -i aieg oci://docker.io/envoyproxy/ai-gateway-helm --version v${vars.aigwVersion} --namespace envoy-ai-gateway-system`}
</CodeBlock>
